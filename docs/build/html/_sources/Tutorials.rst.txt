Tutorials
=========

ATACseq - Chromatin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here I need to link a jupyter notebook that build a subsewt of the Cusanovich raw count matrix and normalize it
Then I need a second tutorial starting with the normalised count matrix and going through the analysis

BSseq - Methylation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here I needto link a jupyter notebook that build a count matrix with a subset of Ecker data.
+ a second jupyter notebook that do the analysis, starting from a "sparse" count matrix
