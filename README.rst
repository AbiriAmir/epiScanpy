Episcanpy â€“ Epigenomics single cell analysis in python
============================================

**Episcanpy** is a toolkit to analyse single cell open chromatin (ATACseq) and methylation (BSseq) data. It is a multi-omic extension of the very popular scRNAseq analysis tool Scanpy.

The documentation for epiScanpy is available at <https://episcanpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>
If epiScanpy is useful to your research, consider citing `epiScanpy`__.

EpiScanpy is based on Scanpy (`Genome Biology`__, 2018) a python package to analyse single cell transcriptomic data (RNAseq). For more information, read scanpy documentation__.
